			<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>
			This company was founded on an pre-existing interest in photography, specifically landscape. As can be seen in many of my images, I enjoy adding an artistic element or incorporating external factors into an image can create a compelling or dramatic image. 
		</p>
		<p>
			I have a background in sales, and I understand how important a first impression can be. Often times, an image is the first impression a client gets of a property. To provide not only an accurate depiction of the space, but also create a mood or feeling that the viewer will assosciate with the property can be difficult but is also very rewarding. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Using the latest technology and practices, I'm able to offer a number of services including high quality edited photo and video from the ground or the sky.
		</p>
		<p>
			Thank you for stopping to visit my website. I'm easy to get in touch with and will gladly answer any questions!
